# Intercom Screening Project
This project is for Intercom's application process. It calculates the distance
between the location of their Dublin office and each user detailed in the
`customers.txt` file (both provided by Intercom). It uses the Great-circle distance
formula detailed [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance). If
the distance between the two if less than or equal to 100, the user's name and ID
is returned.
